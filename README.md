travian games stumbled across my bot and wanted me to remove it because it harms the gameplay.  
since i live in germany i have to take this request seriously. i do not wanna get sued for a project like this.  

i removed a lot of core files, so the bot will not work anymore. i am really sorry for this!  

__a big thanks to everyone who is part of the awesome community i got on discord due to this bot <3__
